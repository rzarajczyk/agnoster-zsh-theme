# agnoster.rzarajczyk.zsh-theme

Original theme at https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme

Please pay respect for the original author!

My modifications are only some customizations made specifically for my!

## Changes in comparison to the original Agnoster:
 * displaying git user.name in the prompt (if it is equal to the $DEFAULT_USER then an emoji ðŸ§‘ is shown)
 * directory path is truncated to last two directories
 * no error message when current directory is `.git`
